# Abstract
Large biobanks, such as UK Biobank with half a million participants, are changing the scale and availability of genotypic and phenotypic data for researchers to ask fundamental questions about the biology of health and disease. The breadth of the UK Biobank data is enabling discoveries at an unprecedented pace.
However, this size and complexity pose new challenges to investigators who need to keep the accruing data up to date, comply with potential consent changes, and efficiently and reproducibly extract subsets of the data to answer specific scientific questions.
Here we propose a tool called ukbREST designed for the UK Biobank study (easily
extensible to other biobanks), which allows authorized users to efficiently 
retrieve phenotypic and genetic data. It exposes a REST API that makes data highly accessible inside a private and secure network, allowing the data specification in a human readable text format easily shareable with other researchers.
These characteristics make ukbREST an important tool to make biobankâ€™s valuable data more readily accessible to the research community but also facilitate reproducibility of the analysis, a key aspect of science.

</p>

# Installation
You only need to install ukbREST in a server/computer; clients can connect to it and
make queries just using standard tools like `curl`. The quickest way to get ukbREST is to use
[our Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hakyimlab/ukbrest/). So install
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and follow the steps below.

If you just want to give ukbREST a try, and you are not a UK Biobank user, you
can follow the [guide in the wiki](https://github.com/hakyimlab/ukbrest/wiki)
and use our simulated data.

## Step 1: Pre-process
If you are an approved UK Biobank researcher you are probably already familiar with this.
Once you downloaded your encrypted application files, decrypt them and convert them
to CSV and HTML formats using `ukbconv`. Checkout the
[Data Showcase documentation](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/).

Copy all CSV and HTML files to a particular folder (for example, called `phenotype`).
You will have one CSV and one HTML file per dataset, each one with a specific *Basket ID*, like
for example the ones shown below for four different datasets with Basket IDs 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444:
```
$ ls -lh phenotype/*
-rw-rw-r-- 1   6.6G Jul  2 23:22 phenotype/ukb1111.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1   6.4M Jul  2 23:19 phenotype/ukb1111.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1   2.7G Jul  2 23:20 phenotype/ukb2222.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1   4.5M Jul  2 23:19 phenotype/ukb2222.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1  1012M Jul  2 23:22 phenotype/ukb3333.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1   192K Jul  2 23:19 phenotype/ukb3333.html
-rw-rw-r-- 1    22G Jul  2 23:24 phenotype/ukb4444.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1   4.1M Jul  2 23:19 phenotype/ukb4444.html
```

Make sure your phenotype CSV files do not have overlapping data-fields (use the latest
data refresh for each basket).

For the genotype data you'll also have a specific folder, for instance, called `genotype`.
Here you have to copy your `bgen`, `bgi` (BGEN index files) and `sample` (BGEN sample) files:

```
$ ls -lh genotype/*
-rw-rw-r-- 1  114G Mar 16 09:51 genotype/ukb_imp_chr10_v3.bgen
-rw-rw-r-- 1  198M Mar 16 10:12 genotype/ukb_imp_chr10_v3.bgen.bgi
-rw-rw-r-- 1  109G Mar 16 09:52 genotype/ukb_imp_chr11_v3.bgen
-rw-rw-r-- 1  201M Mar 16 10:12 genotype/ukb_imp_chr11_v3.bgen.bgi
-rw-rw-r-- 1  109G Mar 16 09:54 genotype/ukb_imp_chr12_v3.bgen
[...]
-rw-rw-r-- 1  9.3M Apr  6 09:41 genotype/ukb12345_imp_chr1_v3_s487395.sample
```

## Step 2: Setup
Here we are going to start PostgreSQL and load the phenotype data into it.
Start Docker in your server/computer and pull the PostgreSQL and ukbREST images:

```
$ docker pull postgres:9.6
```

```
$ docker pull hakyimlab/ukbrest
```

Create a network in Docker that we'll use to connect ukbREST with PostgreSQL:

```
$ docker network create ukb
```

Start the PostgreSQL container (here we are using user `test` with password `test`; you should
choose a stronger one):

```
$ docker run -d --name pg --net ukb -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ukb \
  postgres:9.6
```

Then use the ukbREST Docker image to load your phenotype data into the PostgreSQL database.
Replace the bold text in the command below with the full path of both your phenotype and genotype folder,
as well as the right name of your `.sample` file.

<pre>
$ docker run --rm --net ukb \
  -v <b>/full/path/to/genotype/folder/</b>:/var/lib/genotype \
  -v <b>/full/path/to/phenotype/folder/</b>:/var/lib/phenotype \
  -e UKBREST_GENOTYPE_BGEN_SAMPLE_FILE="<b>ukb12345_imp_chr1_v3_s487395.sample</b>" \
  -e UKBREST_DB_URI="postgresql://test:test@pg:5432/ukb" \
  hakyimlab/ukbrest --load

[...]
2018-07-20 22:50:34,962 - ukbrest - INFO - Loading finished!
</pre>

## Step 3: Start
Now you only need to start the ukbREST server:

<pre>
$ docker run --rm --net ukb -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 \
  -v /full/path/to/<b>genotype</b>/folder/:/var/lib/genotype \
  -e UKBREST_DB_URI="postgresql://test:test@pg:5432/ukb" \
  hakyimlab/ukbrest
</pre>

For **security reasons**, note that with these commands both the ukbREST server
and the PostgreSQL are only reachable from your own computer/server. No one from the
network will be able to make any queries other than you from the computer where
ukbREST is running.

Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/hakyimlab/ukbrest/wiki)
to setup ukbREST in a private and secure network and how to add **user authentication**
and **SSL encryption**.

## Step 4: Query
Once the ukbREST is up and running, you can request any data-field using
[different query methods](https://github.com/hakyimlab/ukbrest/wiki/Phenotype-queries).
Column names for data-fields have this format: `c{DATA_FIELD_ID}_{INSTANCE}_{ARRAY}`.
So if you would like to query the [Standing height](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=50)
data field (which has ID 50), instance 1 (First repeat assessment visit 2012-13), you have to use: `c50_1_0`.

Below we show some examples using **simulated data** (not from UK Biobank, of course),
so you can see how the output looks like.

### Phenotype queries
You can request a single or multiple data-fields using standard tools like `curl`:

Here we request two simulated data-fields: 
* Data field ID 101, instance 0, array 0, which has a column name `c101_0_0`. We rename this data-field to `variable_name`.
* Data field ID 21, instance 2, array 0, which has a column name `c21_2_0`.
```
$ curl -G \
  -HAccept:text/csv \
  "http://127.0.0.1:5000/ukbrest/api/v1.0/phenotype" \
  --data-urlencode "columns=c101_0_0 as variable_name" \
  --data-urlencode "columns=c21_2_0"

eid,variable_name,c21_2_0
9999910,NA,Yes
9999920,NA,No
9999930,NA,Maybe
9999940,NA,NA
9999950,0.4852,Probably
9999960,NA,Yes
9999970,NA,NA
9999961,0.1192,NA
9999921,0.0401,NA
9999941,0.5632,NA
```

**TODO:** example with YAML file requesting hierarchical diseases.

### Genotype queries
Query chromosome 1, positions from 0 to 1000:
```bash
$ curl -HAccept:application/octel-stream \
  "http://localhost:5000/ukbrest/api/v1.0/genotype/1/positions/0/1000" \
  > test.bgen
```

Query by chromosome and a file specifying rsids:
```bash
$ cat rsids.txt
rs367896724
rs540431307
rs555500075
rs548419688
rs568405545
rs534229142
rs537182016
rs376342519
rs558604819

$ curl -HAccept:application/octel-stream \
-X POST -F file=@rsids.txt \
"http://localhost:5000/ukbrest/api/v1.0/genotype/1/rsids" \
> test2.bgen
```
